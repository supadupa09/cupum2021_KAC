2020,1," Action Plan for the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area Climate Proof 2020. climate_change is a reality It is getting warmer, drier, wetter and there is a risk of flooding from the sea or the rivers. Past in summer it has once again become apparent that extreme weather situations are not limited to flooding alone. Thespring and summer of 2018 and 2019 were characterized by prolonged periods of drought and extreme heat.The MRA wants to be and remain an globally competitive region, with an attractive living environment in which can be lived, worked and created safely. And where investments are not inundated by water. The climate adaptation program was launched in 2018, since then 40 colleagues have been working on one climate resistant MRA. This by developing products for accessing knowledge and sharing experiences. Namely, drawing up joint ambitions for new construction and making a climate atlas accessible with uniform stress test maps for the entire MRA. In addition, an exploration of the current basic safety levels for climate proof new construction from all relevant authorities to develop a climate test and testing in four key areas. From stress tests and quick scans of the climate resilience of vital and vulnerability functions aimed at mobility, energy, data centers and industry tips for inland regions and municipalities how vital and vulnerability can be included in the risk dialogues. The Climate Adaptation program action 6 from the current MRA agenda elaborates on this in 2020. The BO space has commissioned work towards a climate proof covenant on 5 March 2020 Area development in Q2 2021, by continuing the steps of the Delta Plan on Spatial Adaptation (DPRA) translate and develop it into the reality of the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area. It closed on November 20, 2018 Administrative agreement on Climate Adaptation gives an impulse to the approach, implementation and measures such as agreed in the DPRA. The MRA plays a role in the connection with the government of local initiatives. This has in 2019 resulted in a government grant of € 150,000 for the Resilience by Design project to be carried out in 2020. The MRA can thus play an even more effective role in the sharing of knowledge and experiences. This in close collaboration with public partners and market parties. Reading Guide This action plan provides the focus for the MRA climate proofing program for 2020. The Amsterdam Metropolitan Area (MRA) offers opportunities to make agreements between governments about the future proofness of the region. The added value of the MRA compared to others partnerships are the connection between climate challenges many related to water management and spatial planning, landscape and economy. In order to stay ahead of the enormous consequences of climate_change, it is essential to finish in an MRA context vote which development principles apply to the climate proof construction of new housing estates (with special attention to key projects from Building and Housing) and the extra protection of vital and vulnerability infrastructure. The drivers have the opportunity to draw the same line on an MRA scale for climate resilience making new developments. In the short term, by adding additional requirements to the housing assignment. And for the long term, by integrating climate resilience even better in spatial planning social plans. This has consequences for the current plan developments because it must be (re) considered whether they are set up sufficiently climate proof. The Delta Plan on Spatial Adaptation (DPRA) contains concrete action and goals for partners to organize the Netherlands differently in many places and thus increasing ones reduce damage from flooding, heat, drought and flooding. The situation the potential consequences are enormous The effects of climate_change can be divided into four themes it is getting warmer, drier, wetter and there is a risk of flooding from the sea or rivers. If the MRA does not adaptation to the changing climate, the damage in our cities nationwide could amount to about € 70 billion in the period up to 2050 (Delta Plan Spatial Adaptation, 2017). The urgency to adaptation and to work on climate resilience is therefore urgent big. The MRA is diversity and at the same time one of the most urbanized areas in the Netherlands with an investment assets of many hundreds of billions of euros. The MRA is one of the many companies that are located there major economic engines of the Netherlands. climate_change can stall this engine. Because of the low location in relation to sea level, the consequences of flooding from the sea, lakes or rivers are enormous. The MRA is therefore vulnerability to the consequences of climate_change. Think of the vulnerability of infrastructure such as the disappearance of escape routes, communication options and the energy supply. Peak showers in both the city and the outskirts cause nuisance and damage. The water system of the In general, MRA has limited possibilities for absorbing fluctuations and extremes. Prolonged drought can lead to accelerated soil subsidence and problems for farms in the polders foundation problems in the cities. Longer dry periods also cause water shortages, for example salinization of the agriculture land and nature areas can occur and the industry is increasingly short of cooling water. Heat stress in urban areas can lead to nuisance, health problems and reduced health labor productivity, due to an increase in the number of tropical sleepless nights. Objective A climate resistant MRA Urgency forces action national policy forces us to act. The foregoing shows that more extreme weather will occur more often and that the Netherlands must become climate proof furnished. Climate adaptation requires involvement and action from many parties and all levels of government. Every party acts on the basis of its own core task and responsibility. The government intends that parties agree on this together create and take action. Parties are brought around the table for this. This includes public and private parties. At the national level, the Delta Program has been in force since 2010 and the National one at the end of 2016 climate adaptation strategy established (NAS). The Delta Plan on Spatial Adaptation was launched on Budget Day 2017 (DPRA) presented. With the DPRA, the joint authorities give substance to the Delta Decision Spatial adaptation of 2014, which states, among other things, that the organization of the Netherlands in 2050 must be climate proof and water resistant. To achieve this, spatial adaptation must be part of 2020 are of policy and implementation plans of municipalities, provinces, water boards and central government. This has consequences for the current plan developments, because it must be reconsidered whether they are sufficient be furnished in a climate proof manner. The DPRA contains concrete action and goals for partners to redesign the Netherlands in many places, thus reducing the increasing damage caused by flooding, heat, drought and floods. This major task differs from place to place and from scale level to scale level. For the necessary acceleration, the DPRA states that all municipalities will receive the Mapping vulnerability to climate_change (stress test) and risk dialogues with all parties are necessary feed. The added value of the MRA The MRA can approach supra local climate challenges integrally with water management, spatial developments and economics. The effects of climate_change can be felt at all levels of scale. This could include Individual level petrified backyards lead to more heat stress, because there is no cooling down take place in the absence of greenery and the nights remain extremely warm Street level extreme precipitation leads to flooding due to traditional spatial planning Urban level (persistent) drought can lead to foundation problems Regional level the protection of vital and vulnerability infrastructure, such as hospitals, data centers and the main road network, against flooding and extreme weather is not optimized. The MRA leaves local what has to be done locally and is already going on. The added value of the MRA as an administrative one consultation structure between neighboring municipalities, provinces and water boards is left with coordination starting points and agreements at regional level. The role of the MRA in this is not about local project level to give advice, because cooperation is already being sought between parties at a local level. In 2019 is at local level with the authorities examined which basic safety level is now applied in projects in the field of climate resistance. This exploration has been converted into a common concept of basic safety level, which is tested on parts of four of the nine key areas, the five remaining areas will be examined in 2020. For the vital and vulnerability functions of energy / electricity, mobility, chemicals / BRZO and data centers, studies have been carried out, stress tests and pilots carried out or started in collaboration with the relevant sectors. In addition, at the local the parties distributed a list of vital and vulnerability functions to be used in the risk dialogues. Climate adaptation does not adhere to administrative boundaries. The MRA provides opportunities for supra local approach issues integrally, lay down joint ambition and act accordingly. The administrative agreements are voluntary but not without obligation. The agreements are being worked out with seven sub regions. The governments themselves are responsible for the effect of the agreements on their organization. As a result, the MRA pre eminently opportunities to make agreements between governments about the future resilience of the region. The effect of new principles in local policy and action is necessary The MRA also offers added value over other public partnerships (such as the collaboration in the water chain), because it can link the climate challenges to multiple policy areas. Such as spatial planning, economy and mobility. This continues from board level to implementation. Work is in progress within the MRA the MRA agenda 2.0, the MRA Climate proof program will be part of the guiding principle Future proof metropolis (see image below). This means that climate adaptation, along with the themes of energy transition, circular economy and biodiversity by working in all administrative implementation lines of the MRA. In 2020, together with the other programs, consideration will be given to where we can strengthen each other and supplement. In addition, the program is closely involved in drawing up the urbanization strategy. This one is planned for decision making in 2020. This process clearly adds value to the role of the MRA as a connecting link between central government and the municipalities / region. The results of the Resilience by Design also serves as input from the program for the urbanization strategy. Activities and products in 2020 that contribute to climate proofing from the MRA region The Space Platform has included an amount of 170,000 euros in the budget for 2020. These funds will be partly used in 2020 for the products for new construction and vital and vulnerability as used in 2019 to develop towards the region, while also further developing the content. These resources are partly used for connection with both central government and other MRA themes. Indicative budget for 2020 and description of products Products Explanational Budget 0.

Made transparent where knowledge gaps lie. Knowledge development and communication tools Depending on the needs of the local authorities, business and people will further shape this given Points for attention when working on a climate proof MRA Ownership with local governments helps to achieve the ambitions for climate proof MRA. Communication to administrators managers and experts helps to link climate adaptation with other development directions. Representation from sub regions, water boards and provinces within the project group. The MRA Climate proof project group is used as a sounding board. In addition, there are for the partial products different project groups. Deploying program managers from the organizations of the administrative program leaders for keeping an overview remain to be recommended. In addition, there are thematic leaders necessary to give substance to the substantive action lines. Haarlem Municipality and AGV Water Board provide sufficient capacity for coordination. The housing assignment should not detract from the importance of the other development directions Due to the speed with which the housing locations must be filled in, it was decided to give priority to the products related to this. A point of attention here is to take a broad look at all to keep looking at development directions and opportunities in the area. Parties need each other to arrive at an unambiguous policy for climate proof action in 2020 There are 4 water boards and Rijkswaterstaat, 32 municipalities, 2 provinces, 1 transport region, 5 safety regions, 4 environment services, each with its own policy. If no agreement is reached on this, this will slow down the elaboration of climate resilience for the MRA. This can lead to uncertainties. Heres to 2018 and 2019 a step has been taken, working through to own policy is a point of attention. This requires communication direction partners and commitment of the partners to the goals that have been agreed to be climate proof by 2020 to have recorded action in policy. Guaranteeing integrality Constant coordination with the other development directions both within the Space Platform and at the Platforms Economy and Mobility is very important to guarantee integration. The water boards are a collaboration partner for climate adaptation in the MRA The water boards are not participants in the MRA covenant, but are an important partner knowledge carrier for climate adaptation. Based on this idea, AGV, together with the municipality of Haarlem, is the initiator of the MRA Climate proofing program. Climate adaptation can largely be found in the connection between water management and spatial planning. Cooperation at local level between municipalities and water boards mainly takes place in partnerships in the water chain and the DPRA working regions. It is a challenge to allow the development of knowledge and practical insights in all partnerships Nations.

meant resilience first place outcome directly measurable statistical analysis predtelecommunications relationship between variability outcome some certainty yet case resilience no clear definition resilience measure against (fussel vincent eriksen kelly adger et al)annex indicators resilience types indicators indicators means encapsulating complex reality single construct (vincent) measuring related conditions component parts direct measurement not possible provide information either matters wider significance actually measured process trend otherwise not apparent (hammond et al) (vincent)indicators come from preexisting data sources census information gathere through surveys interviews focus groups mix indicator types used describe information collected household community

responses translated numerical values inclusion index multiple ways (cri vol) binary represent yes no answers zero one likert scale numbers between one five assigned responses depending whether respondents feel strong agreement strong disagreement bounded ranges describe specific scenario describing best worst scenario assigning scores each (eg) ask participants choose scenario best describes current state threshold responders answer open questions current conditions (egto what extent does your city provide flooding mitigation measures …) score ranging from corresponding worst

category costbased indicators cost resilience cost benefit analysis measure resilience through totalling total financial impacts disaster_risk putting monetary value cost improvements resilience activities (crown agents)using approach higher cost reflects lower overall resilience (bene)best practice choosing indicators choices indicators chosen aggregated result vastly different index resultsfor example different indices national disaster vulnerability often show different indexed scores same national suggesting methodological differences around indices developed what underlying data (fussel)in some cases decisions around choose aggregate indicators directly contradtelecommunications findings from key experts (gall cited fussel)to help avoid eventuality following best practice principles proposed guiding indicators chosen combined specifically related measurement resilience vulnerability specific index clarification provided around what scale index scorecard applied (municipal national global etc) what system attributes evaluates implemented (fussel)questions scale especially important consider aggregation smooth over variation within individual communities hide pockets vulnerability (eriksen kelly)agree concept ual model choose indicators create indicesa first step measurement determine theoretical concepts measured (adger et al)agreement concept ual model entails common understand what meant resilience what qualities capacity constitute resilience what types indicators suitable measuring (fussel eriksen kelly cobb rixford)for instance vulnerability understood function people ecology expand entitlements political economy indicators measuring food availability gnp per capita infant mortality chosen measure vulnerability (downing et al cited adger et al) the lack clear link between indicators underlying theoretical basis common shortcoming indicator selection (adger et al)because resilience encompasses multiple related elements indicators describe variety conditions account multi­dimension al nature resilience her study community resilience example cutter identifies indicators corresponding community resilience including economic institutional transport regulatory attributes (cutter)allow flexible developing index scorecard diversity context s the same community characteristic more less important helping communities cope change depending local context measurement approach applied diversity context sensitive these realities selecting indicators flexible around indicators incorporated weighted make method more universally applicable (fussel)balance data needs including tradeoffs between data accuracy availability limit tendency bias indicators based data availability data quality varies between countries (where indicators multiple context s) difficult agree upon universal list indicators applied across different countries related problem high costs associated gathering sufficient data (braced)while tempting select indicators data available costs gathering data low bias resultsfor instance ease measurement explain considerable indicators regarding physical characteristics community far fewer measurements people social characteristics (center hazard research policy development)in developing good indicators combinational data sources needed particular focus householdfor instance data use infrastructure hygiene behaviour health wellbeing equity only collected level available data from census existing information sources not allow adequate analysis these issues other hand conducting household survey often resource intensivethere thus tradeoff between data accuracy data availability transparent indicators chosen combinedbecause choices indicators chosen weighted influence index results these choices clearly document ensure transparency (fussel)to improve transparency index scores represented multiple subindicesfor instance index illustrates overall vulnerability show system vulnerability social technical environment economic vulnerability individual subindicesby ensuring transparency decisions what indicators chosen aggregated challenge revisited over time make sure assumptions accurate (eriksen kelly) annex indicators resilience ensure statistical methodological rigour normalizing aggregating weighting indicators sub­indicesin addition clear documentation process choose indicators methodological rigour needed combining subindices specifically related indicators normalized scaled weightedfor example combining global national poverty sub­index assigns value each national based total population living below per day (not normalized) global national wealth subindex describes wealth per capita (normalized) would mean mixing two types index each calculated differently (fussel)a similar methodological problem results from combining indicators normalized using different methods (egas nominal scales ordinal scales ratio scales)where weights used considered carefully reflect relative importance each indicator defined study team local experts key stakeholders techniques analytic hierarchy process (ahp) budget allocation (ba) stipulate participatory approaches weighting indicators through transparent agreed upon processes (saisana saltelli tarantola)to test results related indicators normalized weighted techniques uncertainty analysis (ua) sensitivity analysis (sa) (saisana saltelli tarantola)choose independent non overlapping indicators careful selection indicators based well defined concept ual model reduce risk choosing dependent overlapping indicators selecting dependent indicators household income household tax rate effectively doublecounts same phenomenon (fussel)indicators inversely correlated example measuring area median income poverty rate high income signify low poverty another way reduce redundancy overlapping indicators through inductive indices use statistical methods factor analysis (fa) principal component analysis (pca) (eriksen kelly)without careful selection independent variability risk circular analysis resilience defined according set community characteristics those same characteristics are turn indicators measure resilience include indicators capture dynamic pictureindicators often capture snapshot time measuring current level poverty education ecological health yet societies dynamic constantly changing resilience fluctuate significantly over relatively short periods timein addition static indicators measure current state (egof society infrastructure) dynamic indicators suggest changing level economic access wealth health included (eriksen kelly leichenko obrien)static indicators useful identifying current baselines offer different perspective dynamic indicators measure change over timelimit eliminate potential bias respondentsespecially case report card type evaluation respondents deliberately represent city organization flattering light (center hazard

correct this index specify types data sources used encouraging regular reviews index outline steps taken aggregate indicators limit respondents abilities mask results through aggregationchoose indicators refer causes rather symptomsidentifying indicators relate underlying causes help identify area future actionfor example indicator document underlying causes poor water service lack investment infrastructure (which leads poor quality water ultimately higher water costs) preferable one document effects including high rates customer dissatisfactionchoosing causal indicators point

methods example one ask resilience our citys road network? typically approach would similar following first assessment would done understand hazards city case assumed main issue flooding city opt increase height select transport ensure function al anticipated flooding level reached increase capacity stormwater drainage channels collect greater amount runoff make road system more robust enhancing ability absorb withstand urban floodsbut what section city does not access paved transport all (inclusive)? alternative routes flooding reaches unprecedented level (redundant)? does

some cases full resilience value original proposals go unrealized grantees not able raise needed funds during these critical early stages design engineering construction example without additional funds some grantees build small er scale flooding defenses mean community foregoes protection from higher intensity storms greater sealevel risethis suggests grantees need assistance from partners (federal state agencies universities nonprofits) help them identify funding sources financing strategies both short term implement intended resilience benefits during current phase work well longerterm strategies allow them phase additional project components over timefederal agencies monitor these project test assumptions determine whether additional sources funds fact flow these project over longer term grantees able develop additional resources quick timelines the funding challenge compounded fact grantees tight timelines spend disaster recovery dollars forcing grantees focus design project quickly limit capacity identify other sources funding although hoped grantees would able leverage other public private sources funding grantees struggled do sopublic sources (such local state

competitive federal grants under these time framesdisaster recovery funding sources rbd process brought attention challenges using federal funding programs specifically disaster recovery programs fund large scale resilience project despite huds creative allocation cdbgdr funding through rbd competition federal disaster recovery funding programs not well suited these types holistic community rebuilding efforts federal recovery programs were design largely provide funds restore communities were before disaster not rebuild them more resilience future catastrophe sdisaster recovery programs tend reactive backward looking flowing only those area immediately affected disaster limit ability grantees fund interventions more holistically reduce full suite future risk faced region community challenge raises two lessons from rebuild design first grantees need identify other funding mechanisms pathways implementing additional phase work holistically reduce risks the rbd funding alone insufficientfor example grantees focusing building storms urge protection rbd funding need find ways ensure drainage greeninfrastructure improvements made project area either through other funding sources through land_use approaches (eg zoning code stormwater ordinances)second federal agencies congress find ways give grantees more flexible use disaster recovery dollars ways do not merely react last disaster but instead allows them rebuild differently more holistic ways climate_change mindadministrative mismatch between federal funding programsgrantees facing challenges combining funds from multiple federal (or state) programs each program comes own procedural administrative requirementsthis particularly challenging disaster recovery efforts funded through many different federal programs each these different rules timelines funds made available state local grantees making difficult grantees combine streams support comprehensive rebuilding visions example femas benefit cost analysis (bca) process different from huds army corps engineers result bca developed one agency not meet requirements another these challenges exacerbated fact these innovative large scale project require more complex permitting environment review better coordination across agencies jurisdictionsfederal agencies try coordinate administrative requirements maximum extent possible allow grantees combine different sources funding support more comprehensive resilience initiatives programmatic silos different funding sources addition having different rules federal funds often constrained programmatic
