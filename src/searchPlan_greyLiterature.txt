Planning Support Systems for Long-TermClimate Resilience: A critical review

Search Plan for Grey (non-academic) Literature:

The search plan has been adapted from (Godin, et al., 2015) and has three different complementary searching strategies to minimise risk of omitting relevant sources.
(1) grey literature databases,
(2) customized Google search engines,
(3) targeted websites,


(1) grey literature databases

Search terms: "resilience" "urban" "climate" "adaptation" "planning"

The following databases were used:
(1) Open Knowledge repository World Bank
(2) IIHS Knowledge Gateway: https://iihs.co.in/knowledge-gateway/
(3) ADB Knowledge Institute
Kennisportaal Kilmaatadaptatie: https://klimaatadaptatienederland.nl/
Climate Smart GIZ
Wageningen E-depot
EU SCIENCE HUB: The European Commission's science and knowledge service
Stockholm Resilience Center
Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change
https://www.eukn.eu/e-library
https://www.preventionweb.net/english/
https://urbanresiliencehub.org/the-library/
(2) customized Google search engines
creating several search strategies containing multiple combinations of search terms.
rely on the power of relevancy ranking within Google search engines
The first 30-40 links of each search’s hits were reviewed, using the title and short text underneath. This number of pages was chosen to capture many of the most relevant hits while still being a feasible amount to screen.
hand-searching methods used in screening based on ‘inclusion criteria’.
Search terms used:
